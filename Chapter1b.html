           Long ago the king sent men into every corner of 
           the realm to find the symbols of righteousness. 
           The men found more than he intended.

           Along with the eleven true tokens of righteousness
           they found eleven false tokens. Each of the true

           I was one of those men. When the portal in the Tower 
           was opened, the tokens were scattered.
           All eleven are scattered upon the face of the land--as

           The old man reaches into his cloak and pulls out his
           hand to reveal a shimmering trinket. He kneels to open
           an iron-clad box remains in the ashes of his home.
           Inside are a pair of weapons. He silently signals
           each of you to pick up a different weapon and he hangs
           the trinket from your hilt.

           It's name is Faith. To defeat the Prince, you must find the true tokens.
           You must make your way to the Dark Tower. You must
           confront his evil with the only power that can stop him.
           Take up your weapons now and prepare for your journey.
