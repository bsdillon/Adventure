           In the wee hours of the morning your village was attacked.
           The king's troops ransacked everything, taking the fathers
           from the homes, and slaughtering them in the street. Barricaded
           with your mother in a stone cellar you remained hidden.

           In the grey light of dawn, the village is left a smokey husk.
           Weeping is over and the people walk from place to place in a
           pale of silence. Working with the few able bodies left by
           the soldiers, you gather your kin and send them down the road to safety.
           One of the village elders ask you and your sibling to remain.

           This has to stop. Not another village. Not another family.
           I am too old now, but I still remember when the good king ruled.

           I cannot go to fight the Dark Prince, but perhaps I can prepare you.
           Before you leave, I will tell you all you need to defeat Him.

           I have something for each of you, saved from my days as a soldier.
           These are weapons of the light, not the dark. You may use them to
           strike a blow against the Dark Prince, his soldiers, and the Tower.
